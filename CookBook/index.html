        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 Japanese Milk bread alices</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon constarch</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Strawberries</li>
            <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, combine heavy cream, powdered sugar, and
                vanilla extract.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk the mixture until stiff peaks form</li>
            <li>
                Cover the whipped cream and store it in the refrigerator until 
                ready to use
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a shallow layer of vegetable oil in a large skillet over 
                medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry each slice of Japanese milk bread until golden and crispy on
                both sides, flipping carefully to prevent tearing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the fried bread to a plate lined with paper towels to 
                absorb excess oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut each fried bread slice in half and gently open each piece to
                create a pocket.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill the pocket generously with whipped cream and top with three
                strawberry halves.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut each fried bread slice in half and gently open each piece to
                create a pocket.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill the pocket about two-thirds of the way with whipped cream,
                leaving room for the custard.
            </li>
            <li>Spoon custard into the remaining one-third of the pocket.</li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle an even layer of granulated sugar over the custard and 
                brûlée it with a kitchen torch until caramelized and golden. 
                Allow the caramelized sugar to cool and harden slightly before 
                serving.
            </li>

        <h3>Ingregiants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 slices of white sandwich bread</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted melted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>
                If you're using thin white sandwich bread, use 12 slices and 
                stack two on top of each other to make 6 thicker pieces. Just 
                make sure the bread is not too soft—something like fresh Wonder 
                Bread will not hold its shape well. If you're using a whole 
                loaf,slice it into pieces about 1.75 to 2 inches thick.
            </li>
            <li>Slice off all the crusts before moving on</li>
            <li>
                In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the melted unsalted 
                butter, honey, light brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 
                Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then whisk really well 
                until it turns into a smooth, glossy syrup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat each piece of bread generously on all sides with the syrup 
                and place them on a nonstick baking pan—no parchment needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip each one and bake for 
                another 5 minutes until golden and sticky all over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They will 
                feel soft right out of the oven but will crisp up beautifully as
                they cool slightly. Enjoy them warm!
            </li>
        </ol>
